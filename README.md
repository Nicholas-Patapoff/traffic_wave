# trafic_wave
simulating traffic waves

Neat project, I used a model known as the Intelligent Driver Model developed in 2000 by Treiver and Helbing to simulate the flow of single lane traffic during a crash

It's pretty rough but it does exactly what it's supposed to do - simulate traffic waves.

the color of the traffic is dynamic and changes in accordance to its current velocity- which is neat. 

I could expand this project to take on more cars than 60 without glitching, but I would need to completely revamp the way I simulate the cars as it's incredibly inefficient past 40 cars.
I would also write this in C instead of python. 

I'm glad to call this project done, I learned a ton from doing this. I think this is a good starter project for anyone who's comfortable with python syntax and modules.
